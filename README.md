## Description

This app allows the user to search through a directory of employees. Using the search bar the user can search an employee by name. As they type in the letters of the employees name the table of employees updates to display the employees who name matches the charecters on in the search bar. The User is also able to sort the employees by thier names and city in descending or ascending alphetical order.

This app is built using React JS and takes advantage of it state properties and functions and props to dynamically update our display. We call upon the Random User Api with Axios for our data and take advantage of higher order array functions to filter and sort the data.
